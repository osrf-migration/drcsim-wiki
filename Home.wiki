== DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Simulator


Gazebo is the basis for the DRC Simulator, which is used by participants in the DRC program, especially the Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC), a cloud-based simulation competition scheduled for June 2013.  Building upon Gazebo, the DRC Simulator, or DRCSim, comprises additional worlds, models, and code that is specifically required to simulate the DRC domain.

=== Installation

The DRC Simulator is contained within the `drcsim` package.  Follow the [[DRC/Install | installation instructions]] to install it.

=== Using DRCSim

 * [[DRC/UserGuide | DRCSim user guide]]
 * Because DRCSim builds upon Gazebo, new DRCSim users should start with the [[Gazebo Tutorials|http://gazebosim.org/tutorials]].  
 * [DRCSim-specific tutorials]([osrf/drcsim/wiki/tutorials).

=== Releases and plans

 * [[DRC/Change log | DRCSim change log]]
 * [[DRC/Roadmap|DRCSim roadmap]]
 * [[DRC/ReleaseSchedule|DRCSim Release schedule]]

=== Sensor suite

 * The DRC Robot will carry a MultiSense SL sensor head.  Consult the [[Media:MultiSense_SL.PDF | datasheet]].  Software simulation of that sensor head is forthcoming.
